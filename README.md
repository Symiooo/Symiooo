- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon, a PhD student who is interested in programming and corporate finance
- 👀 I’m interested in python, business analytics and value management
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bayesian modeling, statistical inference and sentiment analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to advanced financial concepts and econometric analyses using python

## The Beginning...

Before you head over to my projects, I want to give you some insights in how I hopped on the data science train, what my I am looking for and why I am doing it.
All started with being employed as a management consultant in the transportation and logistics sector. Daily business revolved around shift observations, data gathering and evaluation as well as conducting employee interviews. Days were long, nights were short. The dynamic and demanding environment is always for me the appealing part, when it comes to consultancy projects. Everything was fine, my team and I did mainly a great job and clients were always happy. 

However during the initial analysis phase, I missed working and crunching data. At that time I wasn't able to draw conclusions and make recommendations based on a machine learning model. I wished, I would have the skillset to be a data-driven consultant, being firm in data crunching, able to code and make insightful visualizations which leverage final recommendations and aid clients overcoming their individual, sector-specific challenges.

I started programming using R. Against the background of my PhD endeavour, it was not questionable for me to decide for R due to its strengths in statistical computing and complex visualization creation. However, soon I realized, python could do the same computations. For me python is superior to R due to its increasing popularity which entails a speed advantage in developing new packages and further enhance existing ones. In addition, for me as someone without a computer science background, python's syntax is much easier to comprehend, learn and read.
